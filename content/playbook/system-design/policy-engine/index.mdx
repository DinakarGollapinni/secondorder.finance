SecondOrder is built around a simple idea: **markets change regimes, but good decision systems do not react emotionally.**

The Policy Engine translates observable market conditions into structured guidance—within clearly defined boundaries—so investors can act consistently across cycles.

This is not a forecasting system. It is a decision-support framework.

## 1. Signals vs Policies

SecondOrder separates what the market is doing from what an investor chooses to do.

### Signal Layer (Market State)
Signals describe current conditions. They are global and the same for all users.

**Examples:**
- Trend intact or broken
- Drawdown depth
- Relative strength across asset classes
- Risk regime (**Neutral**, **Elevated**, **Extreme**)

Signals do not recommend trades. They define the environment.

### Policy Layer (Investor Response)
Policies describe how a portfolio responds to those conditions. 

**Policies are:**
- Rule-based
- Bounded by constraints
- Aligned to a baseline strategy

Two investors can observe the same signal and take different, but internally consistent, actions. This distinction is intentional.

## 2. Baseline Templates

Every policy operates relative to a baseline template. A baseline defines:
- Long-term allocation intent
- Risk posture
- Acceptable ranges of deviation

**Examples:**
- **Core Growth**: High equity beta with moderate protection.
- **Balanced**: Resilience across all market regimes.
- **Defensive**: Capital preservation prioritized above all else.

Baselines are not tactical. They represent structural preference.

## 3. Regimes

A regime is a broad market environment defined by observable characteristics, not narratives. Examples include:
- Stable expansion
- Liquidity stress
- Transitional drawdowns
- Deep risk-off environments

SecondOrder identifies regimes using price behavior and relative movement, not predictions. Regimes answer one question: *"What kind of environment are we operating in right now?"*

## 4. Policy Actions

Policy actions are high-level adjustments, not trades. 

**Examples:**
- Maintain baseline cadence
- Build optionality (cash buffer)
- Deploy capital incrementally
- Tilt defensively within limits

Actions are deliberately phrased in portfolio language, not execution language. SecondOrder does not tell you what to buy or sell. It tells you how aggressive or cautious to be.

## 5. Policy Constraints (Guardrails)

Constraints define what the policy will not do, even under stress. 

**Examples:**
- Maximum allocation shifts
- Rebalance bands
- Tilt caps toward defensive sleeves

Constraints exist to prevent overreaction, regime-chasing, and emotion-driven decisions. They are visible by design.

## 6. What This System Is — and Is Not

**This system is:**
- Deterministic
- Repeatable
- Regime-aware
- Designed for long-horizon investors

**This system is not:**
- A prediction engine
- Personalized financial advice
- A trading signal service
- A replacement for judgment

SecondOrder exists to support process, not replace it.

## Why This Matters

Most investment mistakes do not come from lack of information. They come from inconsistent behavior across regimes. 

The Policy Engine is designed to:
1. **Reduce decision noise**
2. **Preserve capital discipline**
3. **Keep investors aligned with their stated intent**

The goal is not optimal outcomes. The goal is repeatable decisions that survive full cycles.
