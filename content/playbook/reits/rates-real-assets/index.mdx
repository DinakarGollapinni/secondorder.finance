## Real Estate without the headaches

REITs allow investors to gain exposure to real estate through liquid, publicly traded securities. 

### Why own them?

- Diversification from standard equity/bond mix
- Correlation with inflation and rents
- Yield component (forced distribution of income)

## The Rate Sensitivity

REITs are hybrid instruments. They behave like equities during growth, but like bonds during rate shifts.

- Sensitive to rising interest rates (leverage cost)
- Perform well during moderate inflation (rent increases)
- Critical to understand the "Regime" they are in.
