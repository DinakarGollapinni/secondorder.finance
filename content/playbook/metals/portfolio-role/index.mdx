## Why gold exists in a portfolio

Gold is **not** a growth asset.  
It is a **stability + purchasing power** asset.

### Its role

- Hedge currency debasement
- Perform during equity stress
- Reduce portfolio volatility

## When gold performs well

- High inflation regimes
- Falling real interest rates
- Monetary expansion
- Geopolitical uncertainty

## When gold underperforms

- Strong productivity-driven equity growth
- Rising real rates
- Disinflationary booms

## How SecondOrder thinks about gold

Gold is treated as:

- **Risk stabilizer**
- Not a return driver

> Position sizing matters more than timing.
