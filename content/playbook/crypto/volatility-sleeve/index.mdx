## Volatility as a feature

Crypto is unique in its combination of high volatility and asymmetric upside. In a SecondOrder system, we treat it as a "sleeve" rather than a core foundation.

### Role in a portfolio

- Asymmetric optionality
- Uncorrelated growth potential (at times)
- Portfolio "spice" that requires strict sizing

## Sizing is the strategy

The most common mistake in crypto is over-allocation. 

- Keep it small enough to sleep through a 50% drawdown.
- Rebalance back to target weight during vertical moves.
- Treat it as a 10-year bet, not a 10-day trade.
