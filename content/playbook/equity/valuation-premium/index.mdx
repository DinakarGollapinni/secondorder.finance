## The SecondOrder framing
Markets don’t punish “bad forecasts” — they punish **fragile processes**.

When the S&P 500 feels expensive, the goal isn’t to predict the next 3 months.
The goal is to understand what **high starting valuations** typically do to the next **5–10 years** of returns,
and then adjust your *process* (contributions, rebalancing, risk budget) so you’re not forced into emotional decisions later.

## The puzzle: “S&P is flat in dollars, but falling vs gold”
Both can be true at the same time.

- If **gold rises faster** than stocks, the *S&P/gold ratio* falls — even if the S&P is stable in USD.
- That usually signals a shift in what the market is paying up for: **liquidity, inflation protection, and risk hedging** rather than pure growth.

SecondOrder takeaway:
> Your base currency can hide regime shifts. Ratios reveal them.

## Are U.S. equities “overvalued”?
“Overvalued” is not a prophecy. It’s a statement about **starting prices vs fundamentals**.

Common ways investors summarize this:
- **CAPE (Shiller P/E)**: a long-horizon valuation lens that smooths earnings over a business cycle.
  It’s widely used precisely because it’s less noisy than 1-year P/E.
- **Concentration risk**: when a small cluster of mega-cap names drives index returns, index valuation can rise even if the median stock is less extreme.

SecondOrder translation:
> High valuation doesn’t tell you *when* the market turns.
> It tells you the market has already “pulled forward” future returns.

## What high valuation usually changes: the next 10 years
Historically, when starting valuations are elevated, **future long-run returns tend to be lower** (not always negative — just lower than average).

That’s why many institutional capital market assumption models forecast more modest U.S. equity returns going forward than investors were used to in the 2010s.

Examples:
- [**Vanguard**](https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/articles/vanguard-economic-and-market-outlook.html) publishes 10-year market outlooks that incorporate valuation starting points into expected return ranges.
- [**BlackRock**](https://www.blackrock.com/institutions/en-us/insights/charts/capital-market-assumptions) publishes long-horizon capital market assumptions with forward-looking return expectations by asset class.
- [**Research Affiliates**](https://www.researchaffiliates.com/asset-allocation/interactive) also publishes expected returns that are explicitly valuation-aware and often show lower expected returns when U.S. equities are priced richly.

SecondOrder takeaway:
> Elevated valuations are a headwind, not a timer.

## What this means for a long-term investor (process, not prediction)
If you invest for decades, the “correct” response is rarely an all-in / all-out call.
It’s usually one of these process upgrades:

### 1) Raise the bar for risk you take
- Keep the equity engine, but be honest about concentration and volatility.
- Make sure your portfolio has *true diversifiers* (not just more correlated equities).

### 2) Rebalance instead of react
Rebalancing is the simplest “anti-emotion” mechanism:
- When equities run hot, rebalancing trims without needing a forecast.
- When equities sell off, rebalancing adds without needing courage.

### 3) Keep contributions steady (unless your plan says otherwise)
Most long-horizon success comes from:
- consistent contributions
- survivable drawdowns
- not abandoning the plan during stress regimes

### 4) Use ratios as context, not commands
S&P vs gold can act like a regime “thermometer.”
But thermometers don’t prescribe medicine — they inform your *process*.

## The bottom line
If U.S. equities are priced at a premium:
- The market can still go higher.
- But the next decade is more likely to deliver **lower average returns** than a cheap starting point.

SecondOrder doesn’t try to guess the month of the drawdown.
It builds a system where drawdowns are **planned for** — not feared.
