## The Default growth engine

Equities represent ownership in the productive capacity of the economy. Over long horizons, they are the strongest engine for compounding wealth.

### Role in a system

- Primary source of real returns
- Captures human ingenuity and productivity
- Higher volatility, higher expected return

## Why Indexing wins

For most long-term investors, trying to pick individual winners adds unnecessary decision fatigue. Broad-based indexing offers:

- Instant diversification
- Low-cost exposure
- Automatic rebalancing as the economy shifts

## Risks

- Drawdown sensitivity
- Valuation noise
- Emotional volatility during corrections
