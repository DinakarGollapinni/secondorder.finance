## Why starting valuations dominate long-term outcomes

Most discussions about markets focus on what happens next: the next rate decision, the next earnings season, the next macro surprise. Yet when returns are examined over full market cycles rather than headlines, a quieter force tends to dominate outcomes.

Starting valuations.

This is not a claim about market timing, nor a forecast about imminent declines. It is an observation about arithmetic. Over long horizons, the price paid for a stream of future cash flows places a boundary on what those returns can reasonably become.

That boundary is often ignored in strong markets, when price momentum and narratives overwhelm slower-moving fundamentals. But it rarely disappears.

## Valuation as a constraint, not a signal

Valuations are often treated as short-term signals: high multiples imply an imminent correction; low multiples imply a buying opportunity. Markets do not behave that way.

Expensive markets can remain expensive for years. Cheap markets can stay cheap longer than expected. Valuation, on its own, is not a timing tool.

Its role is different. Valuation acts as a constraint on long-term outcomes.

When equities are purchased at high multiples relative to earnings, revenues, or underlying economic output, a greater portion of future returns must come from continued multiple expansion. That is mathematically possible, but increasingly fragile. Conversely, when equities are acquired at compressed valuations, returns can emerge even if growth remains modest.

This is why valuation matters most over full cycles rather than short windows.

## What history shows, repeatedly

Across decades of market history, starting valuation levels have shown a consistent relationship with subsequent long-term returns.

Periods that began with elevated valuations, such as the late 1960s, the late 1990s, or the post-pandemic liquidity surge, did not necessarily end with immediate crashes. Some were followed by years of positive nominal returns. Yet when viewed over ten- to fifteen-year horizons, real returns were often muted, uneven, or reliant on inflation rather than genuine purchasing-power growth.

By contrast, periods that began with low or moderate valuations, including the early 1980s, post-2009, or select international markets after crises, tended to deliver stronger real returns over time, even if the path was volatile.

The mechanism is not mysterious. Earnings growth, dividends, and economic expansion move slowly. Valuation changes faster. When valuation starts high, it has less room to help.

## The role of inflation and real returns

One reason valuation discussions often feel abstract is that returns are quoted in nominal terms. A market that rises annually appears healthy, until inflation absorbs most of that gain.

High valuation environments are especially vulnerable here. When prices already embed optimistic assumptions, inflation can quietly erode real returns without dramatic price declines. Investors feel invested and exposed, but purchasing power stagnates.

This is where real measures, such as returns relative to inflation or purchasing power against real assets, become essential. They reveal outcomes that nominal charts conceal.

## Why this matters today

None of this implies that equities are uninvestable, or that high valuations demand exit. Long-term portfolios require exposure to growth assets. The question is not whether to participate, but how expectations are set and risks are managed.

High starting valuations change the character of future returns. They increase reliance on liquidity, sentiment, and continued expansion. They reduce the margin for error. They make diversification, discipline, and rebalancing more important, not less.

Ignoring valuation does not remove its influence. It only delays its impact.

## The second-order view

From a second-order perspective, valuation is not a call to action. It is a context.

It informs how aggressively capital is deployed, how much return is reasonably expected, and how resilient a portfolio is to regimes where growth disappoints or inflation persists. It shapes posture, not prediction.

Markets move in cycles. Valuations set the starting line. Outcomes follow, whether acknowledged or not.
